DNA Sequence Classification with Deep Learning üöÄ
Welcome to this DNA sequence classification project ‚Äî where cutting-edge deep learning meets genomics! Here, we build a powerful pipeline that takes raw DNA sequences and accurately predicts their gene types, unlocking insights crucial for research, diagnostics, and personalized medicine.

What‚Äôs Inside?
Smart Sequence Encoding: We transform raw nucleotide sequences into overlapping 4-mer tokens ‚Äî essentially breaking DNA into ‚Äúwords‚Äù of length four ‚Äî capturing rich biological patterns embedded in the data.

Sophisticated Deep Learning Architecture: Our model expertly combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect local sequence motifs, bidirectional LSTM layers to understand long-range context in both directions, and an attention mechanism that highlights the most important sequence regions for classification.

Solid Training Framework: Using early stopping and adaptive learning rate scheduling, the model trains efficiently while preventing overfitting. Performance is evaluated comprehensively with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to ensure balanced predictions across all gene classes.

Insightful Visualizations: Explore training dynamics, confusion matrices, class-wise precision/recall heatmaps, and feature token distributions to truly understand the data and what the model has learned.

Classical Model Baselines: To appreciate the power of deep learning, we benchmark against traditional machine learning models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes ‚Äî highlighting improvements made by our advanced model.

Why This Project Matters
Accurate classification of DNA sequences is foundational in genomics, helping scientists uncover gene functions, diagnose diseases, and tailor medical treatments. This project demonstrates how modern deep learning methods can unlock hidden patterns in genetic data ‚Äî pushing the boundaries of computational biology.

Getting Started ‚Äî Quick Setup Guide
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Raif-Tanjim/Deep-Learning.git
cd Deep-Learning/DNA_Sequence_DL
This navigates you directly into the folder containing the DNA sequence classification code and data.

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment
It‚Äôs best practice to use an isolated environment to avoid dependency conflicts:

On Linux/macOS:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
On Windows (PowerShell):

powershell
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
3. Install required packages
Install all necessary dependencies with:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you don‚Äôt have a requirements.txt file, install the core libraries manually:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib seaborn joblib
4. Download and organize the dataset
Download the dataset from Kaggle DNA Sequence Prediction.

folder config:
Deep-Learning/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DNA_Sequence_DL/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DATA/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train.csv
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ validation.csv
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test.csv
Place the three CSV files (train.csv, validation.csv, and test.csv) inside this DATA folder.

5. Run the project
You can run the full pipeline  via the Jupyter notebook:
Hybrid (CNN+BiLSTM+Attention).ipynb


Optional Tips
GPU Support: If you have a compatible GPU, install the TensorFlow GPU version to accelerate training.

Mixed Precision: The code uses mixed precision to speed up training ‚Äî ensure your hardware supports it.

Saving Outputs: Trained models, label encoders, and vocabularies will be saved in the repo folder for easy reuse.
