DNA Sequence Classification with Deep Learning üöÄ
Welcome to this DNA sequence classification project ‚Äî where cutting-edge deep learning meets genomics! Here, we build a powerful pipeline that takes raw DNA sequences and accurately predicts their gene types, unlocking insights crucial for research, diagnostics, and personalized medicine.

What‚Äôs Inside?
Smart Sequence Encoding: We transform raw nucleotide sequences into overlapping 4-mer tokens ‚Äî essentially breaking DNA into ‚Äúwords‚Äù of length four ‚Äî capturing rich biological patterns embedded in the data.

Sophisticated Deep Learning Architecture: Our model expertly combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect local sequence motifs, bidirectional LSTM layers to understand long-range context in both directions, and an attention mechanism that highlights the most important sequence regions for classification.

Solid Training Framework: Using early stopping and adaptive learning rate scheduling, the model trains efficiently while preventing overfitting. Performance is evaluated comprehensively with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to ensure balanced predictions across all gene classes.

Insightful Visualizations: Explore training dynamics, confusion matrices, class-wise precision/recall heatmaps, and feature token distributions to truly understand the data and what the model has learned.

Classical Model Baselines: To appreciate the power of deep learning, we benchmark against traditional machine learning models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes ‚Äî highlighting improvements made by our advanced model.

Why This Project Matters
